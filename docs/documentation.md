## Documentation

The documentation for this project is generated by [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) and is hosted at [Read the Docs](https://search-engine-parser.readthedocs.io).
On the root of the project, there exists a `docs` directory housing the sphinx configuration and rst files. 

### Understanding Sphinx

If you have not made use of sphinx before, take a look at this explanatory [blogpost](https://medium.com/@richdayandnight/a-simple-tutorial-on-how-to-document-your-python-project-using-sphinx-and-rinohtype-177c22a15b5b)


### Documenting an Engine

Write the appropriate summary, and document the class and every function as follows

```python
"""@desc 
        # This is the module documentation
		Parser for FakeEngine search results
"""


class Search(BaseSearch):
    """
    Searches FakeEngine for string
    """
    name = "FakeEngine"
    summary = "\t Here lies the summary for a fake engine"

    def fake_function(self, input_1, input_2):
        """
        Describe function here
        :param input_1: describe input 1
        :type single_result: str
        :param input_2: describe input 2
        :type input_2: int
        :return: this is an example return
        :rtype: str
        """
```

### Generating the files

After including the necessary documentation

* Go to the root of the project and then

```bash
cd docs/
```

* Ensure your virtualenv is enabled with all requirements listed in the [requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/bisoncorps/search-engine-parser/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt)

* Run the command

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../search_engine_parser
```

* Write an appropriate commit message

```t
Ex. Included documentation for the Yandex Engine
```
